##Overview
0.5.1 is a library upgrade and bug fix release. We added the [TraceKit](https://github.com/occ/TraceKit) library, which fixed the LinkedIn's buggy error management. This release improves stability and performance.
##New Features
* No new features

##Dev Changes
* Replaced inbuilt error handling with [TraceKit](https://github.com/occ/TraceKit). Inject now throws the correct messages and line numbers when there are errors in the modules
* Renamed file userConfig.js, which stores states/settings for cross-domain dependencies, to relayConfig.js to avoid confusion with the constant userConfig
* Removed explicit relay.html file, which works to manage cross-domain dependencies, because it is generated by grunt when run
* Upggraded testing library [qUnit](http://qunitjs.com) from 1.3 to 1.12
