When [running Inject on multiple domains](/docs/0.4.x/howto/cross_domain.html), you need to specify the path to an HTML and SWF file located on the remote server. These two files enable remote downloading in a CORS-like implementation, while still supporting older browsers. The two paths should be passed in as part of the object literal.
