{% highlight js %}
require('moduleName');
{% endhighlight %}

The default interface for CommonJS, `require()` takes a single parameter as a string. Rarely (if ever) will require be used from the global namespace, but instead from within the context of a module. If the module has not been defined by the time `require()` is called, an exception is thrown.

### AMD Interface

{% highlight js %}
require(['one', 'two', 'three'], function (one, two, three) {});
{% endhighlight %}

AMD specifies an alternate syntax for require, which takes an array of dependencies, followed by a callback function which receives the list of paramters in the order they were listed. Key builtins of `require`, `module`, and `exports` won't resolve to modules, but instead will resolve to their matching module counterparts. It's behavior is very similar in design to [require.ensure](/docs/0.6.x/api/require.ensure.html).
