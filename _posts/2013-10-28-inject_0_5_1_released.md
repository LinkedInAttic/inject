##Overview
0.5.1 is a library upgrade and bug fix release. We added a lightweight library for stacktrace support, which fixed the buggy error management that was causing issues for people trying to identify problems in included code. This release improves stability and performance.

##New Features
* No new features

##Dev Changes
* Replaced inbuilt error handling with Stacktrace.js. Inject now throws the correct messages and line numbers when there are errors in the modules
* Renamed file userConfig.js, which stores states/settings for cross-domain dependencies, to relayConfig.js to avoid confusion with the constant userConfig
* Removed explicit relay.html file, which works to manage cross-domain dependencies, because it is generated by grunt when run
* Upggraded testing library [qUnit](http://qunitjs.com) from 1.3 to 1.12
